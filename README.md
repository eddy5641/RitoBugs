# RitoBugs
This is a list of bugs that I know about for League of Legends.  There are a few that may no longer work; however, Riot tends to patch bugs that get exploited by the community. 

### Note
I do not not how to exploit all of these bugs. I have just recieved proof that they exist.

# Afterthoughts
![sex-ploits](https://github.com/vperpl/sex-ploits) is another repo that is full of exploits (some that I know, some that I do not). I recommend you also take a peek there too.

Riot's client is fucked. The game is actually quite robust, but the client devs need less spagetti to work with. IMO, they should do another rewrite of the client; however, modernize/finalize the API. The API currently for the client looks really good, but has a few bugs that need to be ironed out. The rendering of the client is trash. There are also server-side bugs that riot REALLY SHOULD FIX.
